# Savior

This is a mini web game made for the Ludum Dare 46 game jam. You play as a cat claws sharpener tied to a rope carrying a cat through a pit it's fallen into. Your goal is to rescue it without it touching the spikes.

# How to Use It

- Go to the game's page: <https://xamigames.itch.io/saviour> and press "Run Savior". You can play it in your browser.
- You can move the top of the rope left and right with your mouse, which moves the claws sharpener.

# What I Learned

- Making a complete game in Unity and publishing it.
- Making a game under time pressure. It was my first game jam.
- Using Unity's Spring Joint.
